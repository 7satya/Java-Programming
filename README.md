Just a basic understanding of java

# Creation of Jar file:
Jar file is created from the c++ code so that we can use the functions of the c++ code into the project of java,
and we don't need to write the code again and again from c++ to java only by using .jar file we can access them.

# Reflections
Code to understand the reflections in java to access the classes and their functions without knowing them.
